# YARSA [![Python 3.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
Yet Another RSA Toolkit

# Why do you need another one?
* Many of the Existing ones are too slow
* They have additional unnecessary things
* They are unnecessarily complicated

# Features
* Simple RSA Decryption
* Factorization of n if p and q not given (Using factordb and alpertron)
* Small e Attack
* Weiner's Small d Attach
* Multi-Prime RSA
* Chinese Remainder Attack

# TODO
* Implement the features
